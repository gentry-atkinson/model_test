What metrics will be used with the 6 models?

Overall performance:

1) Accuracy -> number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions
2) F1-> harmonic mean of precision and recall
3) area under receiver operating curve?
4) Sensitivity and Specificity are used often in medical work:
  -Sensitivity -> recall
  -Specificity -> TN/(TN+FP) = True negative rate
5) Apparent Error Rate -> error rate compared to assigned labels
   True Error Rate -> error rate compared to clean labels

Classwise performance:

We want to show that noise that is concentrated in one or two classes can still
impact the performace of the model in other classes.

1) CEV?
2) Classwise F1 or precision?
3) Some presentation of a confusion matrix?
